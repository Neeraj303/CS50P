# [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) 2022 Solutions



## Course description
An introduction to Python programming language. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed for students with and without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values; variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; loops; and objects and methods. Plus exceptions, file I/O, and libraries. Every week you are assigned multiple assignments and you complete the course by making an final project.
